# Spatial Computing Design — Links Homepage

This is a lightweight GitHub Pages homepage to list useful videos and websites for Spatial Computing Design. It follows a modern, Apple-like design language (rounded corners, subtle shadows, clean typography).

Files:
- `index.html` — the homepage
- `styles.css` — styles used by the page

How to publish
1. Create a new repo (or use an existing one).
   - Option A: For a personal site, name the repo `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Push these files to the root of the `main` branch.
   - Option B: For a project site, push to any repo and enable Pages in Settings → Pages (select branch and folder).
2. Commit and push `index.html` and `styles.css`.
3. Visit the Pages URL provided by GitHub.

How to edit links
- Edit `index.html` and update the <ul class="link-list"> items in each section.
- Replace example links with real URLs and titles.

Ideas / next steps
- Add a small JSON file and a JS script to let you manage links in one place.
- Add search/filtering across all sections.
- Add icons favicons and social links.

If you want, I can:
- Convert this into a Jekyll/Markdown-driven layout (so you can edit lists in Markdown).
- Add a small admin UI (localStorage-based) to add/remove links without committing.

Enjoy — tell me which option you prefer next and I'll prepare it.
